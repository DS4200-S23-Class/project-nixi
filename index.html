    <h1>Graduate Admissions Visualization Tool for Admissions Committees</h1>

    <div>
        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        The graduate school admissions process is a critical and challenging task for admissions committees. Evaluating a large number of candidate profiles and selecting the most promising candidates requires a considerable amount of time and effort. The proposed visualization tool aims to assist admissions committees in analyzing candidate profiles efficiently and making informed decisions about admissions. The tool will help committees identify the most promising candidates and understand the factors influencing their admissions decisions. This tool will be useful for admissions committee members with varying degrees of familiarity with data analysis and visualization.

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <h3>Data</h3>
        <p>The tool visualizes data from the "Graduate Admissions" dataset, which includes attributes such as GRE scores, TOEFL scores, college grades, statement of purpose and letter of recommendation strength, undergraduate GPA, research experience, and admission chance. The dataset was collected by Mohan S Acharya and is available on Kaggle. The dataset does not have any apparent biases or ethical considerations. However, during exploration, some missing values and outliers were identified and handled appropriately.</p>
