Hey I'm Nicholas Gjuraj our group did graduate

2
00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.160
student admission predictions.

3
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.039
So our visualization, it's based off

4
00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:11.400
of a data set of about 500 students with

5
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.740
information pertaining to their

6
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.020
admission, things like their GRE and

7
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.900
TOEFL scores, University rating, statement

8
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.699
of purpose, letter of recommendation on

9
00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.640
the scale of one to five, cumulative GPA

10
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.640
research as a binary value,

11
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.060
and a chance of admission from zero to

12
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.019
one.

13
00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.420
So as you can see on the left we have

14
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.000
students binned together by similar

15
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.860
acceptance chances and on the right we

16
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.399
have a scatter plot to compare scores

17
00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.440
against each other so we can see

18
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.800
correlation between certain things. So we

19
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.739
can see between test of English as a

20
00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.420
foreign language and GRE there's a

21
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.180
positive association between students

22
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.219
who perform well on

23
00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.620
one tend to perform well on the other, and

24
00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.739
we can highlight students to see other

25
00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.379
attributes about them

26
00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.140
so like but whenever we hover over

27
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.420
students in the bar graph like there

28
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.119
are four students with a very low

29
00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:14.100
acceptance chance and they also have a

30
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.580
low TOEFL and GRE scores, so perhaps

31
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.220
there's some correlation going on there.

32
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.460
But hovering over students helps

33
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.140
and the

34
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.600
having the color-coded accepted versus

35
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.240
not accepted also helps because we

36
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.100
can isolate certain students so we can

37
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.180
see this student has a pretty low TOEFL

38
00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.159
and a pretty low GRE but they still got

39
00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.799
accepted and we can look and see, oh they

40
00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.720
have a high GPA and their University

41
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.659
rating is pretty weak so maybe that's

42
00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.579
why they got accepted. so how about we

43
00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.600
look now for cumulative

44
00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:54.360
GPA against chance of admission to see

45
00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.159
if that's a really strong correlation

46
00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.960
since he got accepted or she got

47
00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.180
accepted. And as you can see there's a

48
00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.979
very positive correlation between the

49
00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.840
two, and this kind of exploratory

50
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.600
analysis and isolating certain students

51
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.459
with the bar graph on the left and

52
00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:09.959
looking at the correlation is how you

53
00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.039
use our visualization.
